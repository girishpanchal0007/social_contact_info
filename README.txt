INTRODUCTION

Social Contact information provides custom block option to display
Website contact and social details on the page where you want
to display, Also you will be able to list it out in the sidebar
like (Left and right).

We have added 5 contact fields (e.g. Address, E-mail, Phone, Mobile
and Fax) and 6 social links for a website (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter, Youtube, Google Plus and Instagram). For contact details,
We have added contact section title field you will add your desired
title for that section same as for the social media section.

For contact details, We have made email field as required and other all
fields are an option. If you will do not add any value in that field then
that field will not list on the front end side. If you missed label for
entering the value of particular field then we have made default label
as a fieldset title. In social detail, We have given class field option
to add font-awesome icon class over there also we have listed label as well.
For value, you will be to add social media link as I added the placeholder.
We have added custom template to listing out Social and contact fields.

We will come for the full project soon.
