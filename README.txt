INTRODUCTION
------------

Social Contact information provides an option to display
contact and social information in a block anywhere in your site.

We have given contact fields like (e.g. Address, E-mail, Phone, Mobile
and Fax) and social link fields like (e.g. Facebook, LinkedIn,
Twitter, Youtube, Google Plus, and Instagram).

We have given an option to add custom contact title to the
contact information section and this is same for social media links.

For contact information, We have made email field as required and other
all fields are optional. If you will not add any value to those
fields then those fields will not list on your site.
If you will not add any label to those fields then
the label will display as a fieldset/section title.

For contact information, We have given the class option for all
the links where you will able to add class to display image
like (custom CSS image or font-awesome). You will need to add
social media links like I have added the placeholder for those fields.
